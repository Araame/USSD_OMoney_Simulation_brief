## Lessons Learned

While building this project,I learn how to  :
- use json module on python's project for retrieving and dumping datas into a json file
- modify datas that are stored into a json file
- make a submenu related to a main menu
- make navigation into theses menus
- use datas structures for storing datas in a specific case 
- choose the best data structure among others and explain my choice

During the development, I overcomed some challenges as :
